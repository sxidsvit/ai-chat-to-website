### Core Application Idea 

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach has emerged as a powerful technique. RAG combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models, offering a nuanced solution for chatbots. At its core, RAG leverages a retriever to search through a vast amount of data. This retrieved information then augments the generative model's ability to produce accurate responses.

QStash acts as a middleman between you and an API to guarantee delivery, perform automatic retries on failure.
